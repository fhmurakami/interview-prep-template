# Interview Template
This repository aims to share a template I use to prepare for interviews, both national (BR) and international. For this reason, there is a template in `pt-br` and another in `en`.

The ideal is to have a template **for each position** and **adapt** the questions and answers **according to** the **position** and the **company**.
The texts in the template are also **fictional** and **should** be **adapted** to **your reality**.

If you have suggestions, criticisms, or want to collaborate with the project, feel free to open an issue. :)
