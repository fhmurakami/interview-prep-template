    [_your main stack/skills_].

    [_A paragraph about your past experiences_]

    As I neared the completion of my degree, I realized that [_the area you have

    [_Your Job Level++_].

    [_A paragraph about your future expectations, preferably involving the
    company where you'd like to work_]

    Now, I'm looking for an international job because I'm looking for a new

    help me grow personally and professionally.

  (Study the company's values and connect your experience)

    countries, and the flexibility to have a good work-life balance.

- Why should we hire you?
  (How can I contribute to the company?

    - I've already participated in the process of building CI/CD pipelines.
    - I have solid knowledge of Docker.

      balance, and transparency.

        - I have critical thinking and creativity for problem-solving.
    - Weaknesses
        - Introverted
            - This can get in the way at first because I tend to be more quiet
              before I get to know people better.
        - Self-criticism
            - Sometimes, I'm a little hard on myself and feel that I'm not good
              enough. For example, I was avoiding trying an interview in English
              because I thought my English wasn't good.
